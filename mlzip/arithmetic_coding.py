  A class for encoding and decoding data using the Arithmetic Encoding
  algorithm.

  When implemented as infinite precision using integers, the lower and upper
  can converge around 0.5 where lower takes the form of 0b011111..., upper
  takes the form of 0b100000... and the MSB bits can never match. We can
  avoid this problem by removing the second MSB bits from both lower and
  upper when they are 0b01... and 0b10... respectively and keep track of the
  number of occurrences. Eventually, when the MSB bits of lower and upper
  match, we can know that where lower and upper is now either smaller or larger
  than 0.5. If it's smaller, both lower and upper should take the form of 0b01
  followed by finite number of digits and vice versa. That means, when the MSB
  matching happens, we can reconstruct the discarded underflow bits by
  reversing the matched MSB bit.
